# Fake News Detection

## üíª Abstract
The use of social media has grown in this contemporary period. Fake news is becoming more prevalent at the same time that social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are being used more frequently. Nowadays, bogus news on social media has received a lot of attention. Therefore, the need for this project (Fake News Detection) arises from the serious harm it causes both locally and globally. The researchers are already conducting research in the area of machine learning, which is connected to this project. In addition, some research will be done on how to handle the data to identify or separate fake news from true news as part of our proposed project. In light of the current state of the world, where everything is digital, fake news has emerged as the most serious problem. The most lethal tool in society's inventory, fake news has the power to alter people's perceptions of the world and their understanding of the truth. We are using the web interface for the end user of this system so that users can just open the URL and copy/paste or write the news in the text box and after that click on the button of detect and the system will tell the user that the news is fake or real.

Natural language processing techniques are used in the planned project to identify "fake news," or news reports that are deceptive and originate from questionable sources. A model based on the K-Means clustering method can detect fake news. The data science community has responded by moving to resolve the problem. It is impossible to determine whether news is accurate or false with accuracy. In order to identify fake news, datasets will be used in the proposed project, and the accuracy of these datasets will be evaluated using machine learning algorithms. In this proposed research, we employ machine learning methods to identify bogus news using text data.

## üî¨ Purpose
The main purpose of developing this system is to provide as much ease as possible to the whole community. In this way, users can easily analyze or differentiate between real and fake news and they can also better understand the current situation of the country, region, or city by recognizing the real news. This will also facilitate businessmen to plan their business strategy according to the current situation after recognizing the news as Fake or Real. This document describes all the requirements, functions, and capabilities of the Fake News Detection system.
